# Task Dependencies: {{ title }}

## Overview
{% if issue_type == "feature" %}
Task dependency graph for parallel dispatch. Tasks marked `[P]` can run in parallel if they modify different files.
{% else %}
Simple task sequence - execute in order.

## Execution Batches

## Phase Dependencies

## Parallel Safety Rules

Tasks can run in parallel (`[P]`) when:
- Same phase (shared prerequisites complete)
- Different file paths
- No data dependencies between them

## Notes
{% else %}
## Tasks

1. Task 1
2. Task 2
